1. Iterate attributes
    1a. Iterate attribute values (ex. tenant names)
        1ai. Redefine the sum of values by that attribute value
        using A = y/(1-y)*B where
        A is the sum of values for that attribute assignment
        B is the sum of values for the other attribute assignments
        y is the percentage limit (as a float)
    1b. Repeat 1a until nothing changes
    1c. Now we have a new total for each attribute value, so
        change the propertys with that attribute assignment
        by adjusting the dollar value weighted by the value of
        each property
2. Repeat 1. until all percentages are valid
